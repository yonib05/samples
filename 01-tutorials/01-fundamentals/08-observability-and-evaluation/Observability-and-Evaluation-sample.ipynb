    "# Evaluating Strands Agent with Observability with LangFuse and Evaluation with RAGAS\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this example we will demonstrate how to build an agent with observability and evaluation. We will leverage [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) to process the Strands Agent traces and [Ragas](https://www.ragas.io/) metrics to evaluate the performance of  agent. The primary focus is on agent evaluation the quality of responses generated by the Agent use the traces produced by the SDK. \n",
    "\n",
    "Strands Agents have build-in support for observability with LangFuse. In this notebook, we demonstrate how to collect the data from Langfuse, apply transformation as needed by Ragas, conduct evaluations, and finally associate the scores back to the traces. Having the traces and the scores in one place allows for deeper dives, trend analysis, and continous improvement.\n",

    "In agentic workflows, it’s not only important to assess whether an agent accomplishes a task, but also whether it aligns with specific qualitative or strategic business goals—such as enhancing customer satisfaction, promoting upsell opportunities, or maintaining brand voice. To support these broader evaluation needs, the Ragas framework allows users to define **custom evaluation metrics**, empowering teams to tailor assessments based on what matters most to their business or application context. Two such customizable and flexible metrics are the **Aspect Critic Metric** and the **Rubric Score Metric**.\n",

These criteria can represent any desirable aspect of an agent’s behavior—such as offering alternatives, following ethical guidelines, or expressing empathy.\n",
    "- The **Rubric Score** metric goes a step further by allowing for **discrete multi-level scoring**, as opposed to simple binary outputs. This metric lets you define a rubric—a set of distinct scores, each accompanied by an explanation or requirement—and then uses an LLM to determine which score best reflects the quality or characteristics of a response.\n",
