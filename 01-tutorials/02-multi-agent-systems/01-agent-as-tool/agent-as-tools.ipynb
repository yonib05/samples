    "\"Agents as Tools\" is an architectural pattern in AI systems where specialized AI agents are wrapped as callable functions (tools) that can be used by other agents. This creates a hierarchical structure where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A primary \"orchestrator\" agent handles user interaction and determines which specialized agent to call\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Specialized \"tool agents\" perform domain-specific tasks when called by the orchestrator\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach mimics human team dynamics, where a manager coordinates specialists, each bringing unique expertise to solve complex problems. Rather than a single agent trying to handle everything, tasks are delegated to the most appropriate specialized agent.\n",
