    "- ✅ **Agent Short-Term Memory**: Conversartion History, agent state and request state\n",

    "- ✅ **Memory Based capabilities**: `mem0_memory` tool stores, retrieves and lists memories\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "1. Strands agents remembers messages through the conversation history\n",
    "2. Agent state provides key-value storage for stateful information to be stored\n",
    "3. Request state dictionary persists throughout the event loop cycles - Separate from agent context\n",
    "4. Tools can access stored user preferences and context from historic messages\n",
    "5. Memory makes agents truly personalized\n",
